# Hydra Documentation Working Group

The [Hydra Documentation Working Group](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Documentation+Working+Group) contains most of the relevant details of the working group.

This repository is mainly for issue tracking, but may also include artifacts of the working group that we want to version and/or collaborate on with pull requests.
