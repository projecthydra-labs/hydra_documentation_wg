# Hydra Documentation Working Group

_NOTE: The Call for Participation (CfP) for this working group is open from **Thursday, April 5, 2017** through **Wednesday, April 19, 2017**. After that, any further changes to this charter will be made only by consensus of the working group's active members._

## Definitions

  * **inline documentation:** YARD documentation within code comments.
  * **instructional documentation:** Any documentation available on the web that is not YARD documentation.

## Scope & Objectives

This working group has been chartered to implement concrete improvements to developer documentation within the Hydra community. These improvements were identified during LDCX^8 and the Hydra Developer Congress held on March 27-31, 2017 at Stanford.

Some work has already been completed toward those improvments, and it was concluded that there was sufficient interest and capacity to setup a working group to organize the remaining work.

This working group has the following objectives:

  1. Increase YARD documentation coverage and improve quality for repositories in https://github.com/projecthydra.
  1. Establish http://projecthydra.github.io as the primary home for developer documentation.
  1. Define community expectations for coverage and quality of documentation, both inline and instructional.

## Deliverables

### Improving inline docs
  1. Choose one or more tool for measuring coverage and quality of inline docs.
  1. Use metrics from chosen tools to establish achievable targets.
  1. Achieve the targets.

### Improving http://projecthydra.github.io
  1. Implement a theme and layout that provides easier discovery and navigation than current options (e.g. the Duraspace Wiki).
  1. Reorganize existing content on projecthydra.github.io, preserving any legacy links.
  1. Identify instructional documentation from other sources that should be migrated http://projecthydra.github.io, archived somewhere, or deleted.

### Defining community expectations for documentation
  1. Propose a policy for setting, and maintaining, a threshold of inline documentation coverage and quality.
  1. Propose a policy for where instructional documentation should be created and maintained, and where it should not.
  1. Propose contributing guidelines for adding and modifying instructional documentation.

### Time frame

_The timeframe for activities and producing deliverables should also be included in this section. Included should be a sunset date for the group._

## Meeting Times

The working group meets every _[FREQUENCY]_ on _[DAY OF THE WEEK]_ from _[START TIME]_ to _[END TIME]_.

## Communication channels

1. Slack channels under the Project Hydra team (project-hydra.slack.com):
