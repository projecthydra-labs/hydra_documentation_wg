## Scope & Objectives

This working group has been chartered to implement concrete improvements to developer documentation within the Hydra community. These improvements were identified during LDCX^8 and the Hydra Developer Congress held on March 27-31, 2017 at Stanford.

This working group has the following objectives:

  1. Increase YARD documentation coverage and quality for code living under https://github.com/projecthydra.
  1. Enhance projecthydra.github.io to be the primary home for developer documentation.
  1. Migrate documentation from various locations into the new home.


## Deliverables

1. Inline documentation (YARD)
  1. Add Inch CI badges to all repositories under https://github.com/projecthydra.
  1. Establish desired thresholds of Inch CI metrics
